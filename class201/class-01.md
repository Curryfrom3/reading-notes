## Getting started

Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
HTTP sends data, from me to you.
With headers and payloads, it flows,
Through wires and servers, it goes.
TCP ensures its safe delivery,
HTTP's protocol, its revelry.
A surplus of messages, go back and forth,
Allowing  the web's to show its worth.

How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?

What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?

Variables are important in JavaScript because they allow you to store and manipulate data in your program. They make your code more readable and reusable. For example, you can use a variable to store a user's name and then use that variable to display the user's name on the screen or in a message. They also allow you to store intermediate results of computations or data that is being passed between different parts of your program.

Also, variables declared with let and const have block scope, which means they are only accessible within the block in which they are defined. Variables declared with var have function scope, which means they are accessible within the entire function in which they are defined.

var x = 10; // declares a variable named x and assigns it the value 10

let y = "CodeFellow"; // declares a variable named y and assigns it the value "CodeFellow"

const z = true; // declares a variable named z and assigns it the value true

## introduction to HTML
