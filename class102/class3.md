[Git intro(https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/)]

Git is a version control system (VCS) that is widely used for software development and other projects that involve multiple people working on the same files. It allows developers to keep track of changes to their code, collaborate with others, and roll back to previous versions if necessary.

Here are some basic concepts in Git:

Repository: A repository is a collection of files and the history of changes to those files. Developers can create a new repository or clone an existing one to begin working on a project.
Committing: When a developer makes changes to a file, they can save those changes as a "commit". Each commit has a message that describes the changes that were made. This message is important to understand the context, who made the changes and why.
Branching: In Git, developers can create separate branches of a repository to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously. This allows for multiple people to work on the same codebase without interfering with each other's changes.
Merging: When a developer finishes working on a branch, they can "merge" their changes back into the main branch of the repository. This allows other developers to see the changes and build on them.
Pulling and pushing: Developers can "pull" changes from a remote repository, which means downloading the latest version of the code to their local machine. They can also "push" their changes to a remote repository, which means uploading their code to a centralized server.
Git provides many other functionality and options like merging conflicts, rollback, stash, diff and more.
