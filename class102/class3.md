A wireframe is a visual representation of a user interface that is used to plan the layout and functionality of a website or application. It is a simplified version of the final design, and is typically created using simple shapes and lines to represent elements such as text boxes, buttons, and images. Wireframes are often used to plan the navigation and overall structure of a website or application before the visual design is developed.

Design, in the context of user interfaces, refers to the look and feel of a website or application, including the colors, typography, and overall visual aesthetic. Good design takes into account factors such as usability, accessibility, and branding to create a user-friendly and visually appealing experience.

Mozilla is the organization behind the Firefox web browser, as well as other open-source projects. They also provide documentation and resources for web developers, including information on HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which is the standard language used to create web pages.

HTML is a markup language that is used to structure the content of a web page. It consists of a series of elements, such as headings, paragraphs, and lists, that are denoted by tags. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< and >), and are used to define the structure and layout of the content.

Here are some basic HTML tags:

<html> is the root element of an HTML document.
<head> contains meta information about the document, such as the title.
<title> is the title of the document, which is displayed in the browser's title bar.
<body> contains the main content of the document.
<h1> to <h6> are headings of different levels.
<p> is used for paragraphs of text.
<a> is used for links.
<img> is used to embed images.
<ul> and <ol> are used for unordered and ordered lists, respectively.
<li> is used for list items.
Mozilla has a comprehensive resources and tutorials on web development, including HTML, CSS and Javascript on website like MDN web docs. They also provide examples and explanations for different elements and attributes that you can use in HTML.

Semantics refers to the meaning of words and phrases in a language or system. In the context of web development, semantics refers to the use of HTML elements and attributes in a way that accurately describes the meaning and structure of the content on a web page. This helps search engines, screen readers, and other software understand the content and present it in an appropriate way.

The use of semantic HTML elements, such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, <footer>, <figure> etc, helps browsers, search engines and assistive technologies to understand the structure and purpose of the content on the page, providing rich and contextually relevant information for the user.

For example, using an <h1> tag for the main title of a web page and <p> tag for the paragraph text is a semantic choice, because it makes the structure and purpose of the content clear.

It's also important to use semantic attributes, such as alt for images and label for form fields to make web content more accessible, and provide extra details and context to the search engines.

In conclusion, I feel very confident in my comprehension of the above material.
