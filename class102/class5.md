CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It's a way to add style and layout to web pages. 

With CSS, developers can control things like the color, font, and spacing of text and elements on a website.

It allows you to separate the presentation of a website from its content, making it easier to make changes to the design without affecting the underlying HTML code. 

CSS can be used to create simple visual effects such as background colors and text formatting, as well as more complex layouts and animations.

There are many different codes, or "properties," that can be used in CSS to control the presentation of a website. Some examples include:

color: sets the color of text

font-size: sets the size of text

background-color: sets the background color of an element

width and height: sets the width and height of an element

margin and padding: sets the amount of space around an element

border: adds a border around an element

display: sets how an element should be displayed on the page (e.g. as a block or inline element)

position: sets how an element should be positioned on the page (e.g. relative, absolute, fixed)

transition and animation: adds transition and animation effects to an element

:hover, :active, :focus : used to create effects on different states of an element.

These are just a few examples of the many properties that can be used in CSS to control the presentation of a website.
