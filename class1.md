## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a way of formatting text on the internet. It lets you make things bold, italic, or strikethrough. It also lets you create lists, add links, and make headers. Here are some examples:

To make text italic, you can surround it with one asterisk, like this: *italicized text*

To make text strikethrough, you can surround it with two tildes, like this:

To create a list, you can start each line with a dash or a number and a period, like this:

-item 1
-item 2
-item 3

To create a link, you can put the text you want to show in square brackets and the link in parentheses, like this:
